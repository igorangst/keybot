========================
Arduino KeyBot TODO list
========================

1. Fixes and easy to implement features
---------------------------------------

* Fix serial comunication
   The client freezes on parameter restore, what's going on?
* Save and restore
   Finish saving and restoring of parameters.
* Set rest positions
   Maybe change SET_LO and SET_HI messages to three bytes, including
   the index of the finger to set. This will make the interface
   cleaner and allow the server to take over the logic to select the
   finger to configure.
* Documentation
   Add instructions on how to build the bot, and some nice pictures or
   videos.


2. Ideas for future improvements
--------------------------------

* Auto calibration
   Use acoustic sensor to detect key presses and set the lower rest
   positions automatically. Hi rest positions can then be set to a
   constant offset angle from the lo rest positions.
* GUI
   Add a nice gui. At this time, there is not really a need for this,
   but it might come in handy later.
* More keys
   Make the whole design scalable for more keys, or add black keys.
